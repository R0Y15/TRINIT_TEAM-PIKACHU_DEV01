## Short Glimpse of the Site
HEYA world!!

The wait is finally over! This website will help you with all the possible question patterns by the VIT-B faculties.

This page will not only help you by providing the paper lists (year-wise) but also will provide you with all the previous question papers that the seniors attempted.

This website will also contain the solutions to the question papers for a better understanding and one can achieve better grades in their respective branches.

[Since this pages is in beta form so this dosen't have the solutions page but will be live soon ;)]
